# Farm Water Delivery - Water Ordering API

This application is a water ordering API which provides a set of endpoints
covering the specification of the requirements described [here](RubiconCodingChallenge.pdf).

The application features a couple of endpoints for ordering water, querying existing orders and cancelling an order.

The application allows you to add,modify and delete existing customers and contact details. These three operations has side effects on the data structure of an in-memory [DataStore](src/main/java/au/com/belong/codingtest/joshluisaac/infrastructure/DataStore.java)
which internally uses a [ConcurrentHashMap<K,â€‹V>] while keeping track of these changes.
These changes are also flushed/written to disk to prevent lost updates on next application restart and to keep both the in-memory cache and dataset in a eventually consistent state.
The dataset path is located here [here](config/CustomerDataSet.json). On startup, the application gets preloaded and initialized with a set of customers from the same JSON dataset.




## Prerequisites

- Adopt/Open/Oracle JDK 11+ or higher (One of Adopt, Open or Oracle JDK)
- Apache Maven v3.6.1 or Gradle v6.0.1 (SDKMAN makes it very easy to set up these build tools).

You can follow the steps here on how to setup [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install) and to install gradle using SDKMAN refer to this [link](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Gradle and gradle wrapper

The application comes bundled with Gradle wrapper which makes it easy to compile, test, build and run the application without having to worry about downloading Gradle. The [gradle wrapper scripts](gradlew) *nix or [Windows](gradlew.bat) will take care of this.

## Maven/Gradle - Running the test suite

Running this command will compile as well as run all tests

```bash
mvn compile test
```

or using Gradle

```bash
gradle test
```

Executing this command using maven will yield the following console output

## Maven/Gradle - Building the source

The following commands will download all the required dependencies and create an executable JAR file in the target directory.
The executable JAR was created using [Spring Boot Maven Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/index.html)

```bash
mvn clean install
```

or using Gradle

```bash
gradle clean build
```

## Maven/Gradle - Building and running the app from terminal in one command

Execute the below command to build and execute the app from terminal.

```bash
mvn clean install && java -jar target/farm-water-delivery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using Gradle

```bash
gradle clean build && java -jar build/libs/FarmWaterDelivery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Maven - Running the app from spring boot

Execute `mvn spring-boot:run` from terminal.

Or using Gradle `gradle clean bootRun`

These commands would run the application in-place without actually building a target JAR file

You should see the following logged to console.

```


## Accessing the application

You an access the app using this URL **`http://localhost:8887`** running on default port **8887**.

Port number is configurable. Just in case you have another app/service running on port 8887, you can update the port number in
[application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) using this property

**`server.port=YOUR_NEW_PORT_NUMBER`**


## Code coverage

### Jacoco code coverage
While the goal of the test harness is to cover as much edge and corner cases, that naturally led to a wider coverage of over 85%.
Code coverage was both executed as part of maven build cycle using [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco)  and from IDE

![alt text][codeCoverage_Ide2]

![alt text][codeCoverageJacoco]


### Coverall report
Executing the following command will generate Jacoco and [coveralls coverage reports](https://coveralls.io/github/joshluisaac/FarmWaterDelivery?branch=master).
```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report coveralls:report
```
